# duResultScrap
2017-18 Semester 1, 2 result scraping script 

## Description
`form_aspx.py`: Grab student list from page and Send post request to server to login in and scrap result

<strike> **Note:** This script is not fully automated you might need to clean the data obtained from `student_name.py` and `student.py` </strike>

## Disclaimer
I made the script as a fun project and for learning purposes. If you use this script it should be for **learning purpose only**. 

Please, try not to harass the servers.
